#Installation Instructions
The best package to install python with is Anaconda. This is a dedicated package that not only includes
Python, but also a large number of third party packages that are widly used in Python such as numpy or
matplotlib. Anaconda has has nice features for managing, removing, and adding packages.  If possible, 
the 32-bit version should be installed since not all packages support 64-bit.

To install Anaconda, you can go directly to their [website](http://continuum.io/downloads#py34), or use the following links below, depending on your OS.

*Windows*: 32-bit Python 3.4
Mac: 64-bit Python 3.4 (requires OS X 10.7+)
Linux: 32-bit Python 3.4 (After downloading, in the shell execute: bash Anaconda3-2.3.0-Linux-x86.sh)

####Reason for Using Python 3
PyCon exclusively uses Python 3. The reason for this is that Python 3 is the most up to date version of
the language and as such should be adopted as the primary version. While Python 2 is still widely used
by many people, their reasonings are quickly dwindling for why they shouldn't move to Python 3 (packages
aren't supported, etc. are no longer excuses). In the programming world, it is prudent to wait for something
to become established before adopting it, but it is also crucial to be as up to date as possible. For that
reason, Python 3 is going to be used in this group.
