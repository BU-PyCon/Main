The Boston University Python Conference (BU PyCon) is an open engagement of graduate students in 
the Boston University Astronomy Department that is meant to foster teaching and learning of programming 
fundamentals while being centered around the Python programming language. The Python language is the 
focus of this undertaking due to its widespread use amongst researchers and programmers alike as
well as its general ease of use and expansive employment of programming paradigms. However, this
project is by no means restricted to the use of Python and will variously employ the use of other
languages such as Java, SQL, Visual Basic, etc. as desired.

The general goal of these meetings is to expand the programming knowledge of those in attendance 
and fill in  the gaps in programming knowledge that may exist from ad hoc learning as is often 
the case in those who apply programming to research. This goal is accomplished through two main 
tasks that we will attempt to undertake in each meeting.

1) An experienced member of the group will teach a particular subject that s/he is knowledgeable 
   about. This is intended to be an open style of teaching where no single attendee is the teacher
   and no single attendee is the student. Instead this is a communal effort where knowledge is 
   shared by the knowledgeable. If you have the knowledge and skills to teach a particular subject
   to the group, by all means, you should teach it.

2) The group will collaborate and work on coding projects together. The group projects may be to 
   create simple, not-so-useful programs to learn the implementation of new ideas, or it may also
   be to develop a useful program either for research or some astronomy related task. The desired
   outcome is to provide a framework for learning how to work with groups to develop code as well
   as foster proper programming etiquette and standardizations. This will employ the use of Github,
   a standard amongst group coding projects.
